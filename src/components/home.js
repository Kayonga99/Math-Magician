        The word mathematics comes from Ancient
        Greek máthēma (μάθημα), meaning &quot;that which is
        learnt,&quot;[10] &quot;what one gets to know&quot;
        hence also &quot;study&quot; and &quot;
        science&quot;. The word for &quot;mathematics&quot;
        came to have the narrower and more
        technical meaning &quot;mathematical study&quot;
        even in Classical times.[11] Its adjective
        is mathēmatikós (μαθηματικός),
        meaning &quot;related to learning&quot;
        or &quot;studious,&quot; which likewise further came to mean
        &quot;mathematical.&quot; In particular,
        mathēmatikḗ tékhnē (μαθηματικὴ τέχνη; Latin:
        ars mathematica) meant "the mathematical art.

      <p className="paragraph">
        &quot; Similarly, one of the
        two main schools of thought in Pythagoreanism
        was known as the mathēmatikoi
        (μαθηματικοί)—which at the time meant
        &quot;learners&quot; rather than
        "mathematicians" in the modern sense.&quot;

      <p className="paragraph">
        &quot;In Latin, and in English until around 1700,
        the term mathematics more commonly meant &quot;astrology&quot;
        (or sometimes &quot;astronomy&quot;) rather than "mathematics";
        the meaning gradually changed to its present one from
        about 1500 to 1800. This has resulted in several mistranslations.
        For example, Saint Augustine's warning that Christians
        should beware of mathematici, meaning astrologers,
        is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.[12]

      <p className="paragraph">
        The apparent plural form in English
        goes back to the Latin neuter plural mathematica (Cicero),
        based on the Greek plural ta mathēmatiká (τὰ μαθηματικά),
        used by Aristotle (384–322 BC), and mean
        ing roughly &quot;all things mathematical&quot;,
        although it is plausible that English borrowed only
        the adjective mathematic(al) and formed the noun mathematics anew,
        after the pattern of physics and metaphysics,
        which were inherited from Greek.[13] In English,
        the noun mathematics takes a singular verb.
        It is often shortened to maths or, in North America, math.[14]&rdquo;
